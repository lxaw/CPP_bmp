## :grey_question: What is it?
* Program that makes basic image files (.bmp files).
* Can do some drawing, like change pixel colors and make rectangles.
* Linear gradients! Working but a bit clunky.

## :package: Modules / Packages:
C++:
* Standard C++ libraries that require no installs.

:exclamation: Note:
* Loads of this was referenced from https://solarianprogrammer.com/2018/11/19/cpp-reading-writing-bmp-images/.
* This project is not for me to say "I invented this code". I learned a lot from the above post, and added some of my own functionality. 
* Please do read and star / whatever the GitHub of the original post.
